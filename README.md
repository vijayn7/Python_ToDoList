# To-Do List Application

This Python project is a simple GUI-based To-Do List Application using Tkinter. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, viewing, completing, and deleting them. The tasks are stored in a file for persistence.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks using the input field and the "Add Task" button.
- **View Tasks**: All tasks are displayed in a list box.
- **Complete Tasks**: Select a task and mark it as completed, which removes it from the list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list without marking them as completed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to a file (`tasks.txt`) on exit and loaded at startup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x with Tkinter installed (usually included with Python).

### Installing

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd todo-list-python
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the main Python file.

   ```bash
   python todo_list_gui.py
   ```

3. Use the GUI to add, complete, or delete tasks.

## Usage
